# Quering the ontology 

The users, transparently through the ontology, have access to all 9 different databases.
The users retrieve "unified" information writing SPARQL queries.

For example :
 - correlation between weather and pollution data
 - correlation between citizen request's and city's services
 - correlation between city's human resources department and city's services
 - quering city's ontology domain concepts
