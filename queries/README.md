# Quering the ontology 

Quering the data stored to the 9 distinct databases through the ontology (transparent to the users).
The users retrieve "unified" information writing SPARQL queries.
For example :
 - weather data correlation to pollution data
 - citizen requests correlation to city's services
 - city's human resources correlation to city's services
 - quering ontology domain concepts
