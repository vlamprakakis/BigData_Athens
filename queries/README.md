# Quering the ontology 

Quering the data stored to the 9 distinct databases through the ontology (transparent to the users).
The users retrieve "unified" information writing SPARQL queries.
For example :
 - correlation between weather and pollution data
 - correlation between citizen request's and city's services
 - correlation between city' human resources department and city's services
 - quering ontology domain concepts
